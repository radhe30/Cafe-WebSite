# E-Commerce
An e-commerce website to sell homemade products, built using HTML and CSS, serves as a simple and elegant platform to showcase and sell your handcrafted items online. This project can include essential features like a visually appealing homepage, a well-organized product listing page, and an intuitive shopping cart, all designed with a clean and responsive layout.

By leveraging HTML for the structure and CSS for styling, you can create a user-friendly, attractive interface where customers can browse, select, and purchase your handmade products with ease.
